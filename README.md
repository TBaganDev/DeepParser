# Deep Parser
Program to parse and edit Barotrauma Content Packages, providing an improved Barotrauma Modding Experience.

Note this is incomplete and a **WIP**!

### Project Aims
1. Create a simple text-editor style ui, akin to Atom, Eclipse, IntelliJ or Visual Studio
2. Implement a XML Parser
3. Begin to create Data Structures to manage file-read Barotrauma Game Objects - i.e: Items, Characters, Texts (etc)
4. Introduce a Config file for altering the DeepParser Editor itself
5. Begin to fill out all file-read Barotrauma Game Objects, to allow for interpretation
6. Introduce functionalities which seperate the program from just a fancy text editor, such as identifier attribute collision detection
7. Helpful information boxes to describe attributes and their meaning

See the [projects page](https://github.com/nullmaton/DeepParser/projects/1) for info on progress.

### Release
When the initial project is up to standard, I will release it to the Community, with the hopes of allowing other programmers to help further develop the application for each new update of the base game. Note that when the project's first version is officially released, not all of the game's moddable content will be included.
